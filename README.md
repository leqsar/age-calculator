## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The year is in the future
  - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- See the age numbers animate to their final number when the form is submitted

## My process

### Estimated time

4 hours

### Actual time

6 hours

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) - Vue framework
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/)
- [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs-dev.translate.goog/?_x_tr_sl=en&_x_tr_tl=ru&_x_tr_hl=ru&_x_tr_pto=sc)

### What I learned

- Basics of VUE
  - emit
  - single page component
  - computed properties
  - methods
- A little bit of basics of GSAP
- Reminded myself how to work with SASS

### Continued development

I'll stick to learning VUE. There is still a lot of info I don't know. In the closest future i want to develop app with API requests using VUE.
Also I want to create some more complicated animations using GSAP.
